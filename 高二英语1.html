Our perception of time is often <span class="vocab-highlight">subjective</span>, influenced by our emotions and circumstances.

Einstein's theory of relativity <span class="vocab-highlight">revolutionized</span> our understanding, demonstrating that time is not absolute but rather <span class="vocab-highlight">relative</span> to the observer's frame of reference. This means that time can <span class="vocab-highlight">dilate</span> or contract depending on factors such as velocity and gravitational pull.

                        Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years, transforming various aspects of human life. From virtual assistants that respond to voice commands to sophisticated algorithms that predict weather patterns, AI applications continue to expand across industries. One of the most promising areas is healthcare, where AI systems are being developed to assist in medical diagnosis and treatment planning.

                    <p class="passage-text">
                        Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables computers to learn from data without explicit programming. This capability has proven particularly valuable in analyzing medical images such as X-rays and MRIs, where AI algorithms can detect patterns that might escape human observation. Studies have shown that in some cases, AI systems can match or even exceed the accuracy of trained radiologists in identifying early signs of diseases like cancer.

                        Despite these advancements, concerns remain about the integration of AI into healthcare. Issues of privacy and data security are paramount, as AI systems rely on large amounts of patient data to function effectively. There are also questions about liability in cases where AI recommendations lead to incorrect diagnoses or treatment plans. Additionally, some healthcare professionals express apprehension about the potential dehumanization of medical care, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the doctor-patient relationship.

                        As research continues, many experts believe that the future of healthcare lies in a collaborative approach, where AI augments rather than replaces human expertise. By handling routine tasks and analyzing large datasets, AI can free up medical professionals to focus on patient care and complex decision-making, ultimately improving healthcare outcomes.

                    <p class="passage-text">
                        The concept of emotional intelligence (EI) has gained significant attention in psychological research and organizational management over the past few decades. Coined by psychologists Peter Salovey and John Mayer, and popularized by Daniel Goleman's 1995 book, emotional intelligence refers to the ability to recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions, as well as recognize, understand, and influence the emotions of others.
                    </p>
                    <p class="passage-text">
                        Research suggests that EI consists of several key components: self-awareness, the ability to recognize and understand one's own emotions; self-regulation, the capacity to manage and control one's emotional responses; motivation, the drive to achieve goals despite setbacks; empathy, the ability to understand and share the feelings of others; and social skills, the proficiency in managing relationships and building networks.
                    </p>
                    <p class="passage-text">
                        Studies have demonstrated that emotional intelligence can be a better predictor of success in both personal and professional contexts than traditional measures of intelligence, such as IQ. In the workplace, employees with high EI tend to be more effective leaders, better team players, and more resilient in the face of stress. They are also generally more satisfied with their jobs and have higher rates of career advancement.
                    </p>
                    <p class="passage-text">
                        Unlike IQ, which remains relatively stable throughout life, emotional intelligence can be developed and enhanced through intentional practice and training. Techniques such as mindfulness meditation, journaling for self-reflection, and active listening can improve various aspects of EI. Many organizations now incorporate emotional intelligence training into their employee development programs, recognizing its value in fostering a positive work environment and improving overall productivity.

These natural oases offer respite from the concrete jungle, contributing to both physical and mental well-being.

                        Environmentally, urban green spaces help mitigate the "heat island" effect, where cities are significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas due to human activities and infrastructure. Vegetation absorbs solar radiation, provides shade, and releases moisture through transpiration, cooling the air and reducing energy consumption for air conditioning. Green spaces also improve air quality by absorbing pollutants and carbon dioxide while releasing oxygen.

                    <p class="passage-text">
                        From a public health perspective, access to green spaces encourages physical activity such as walking, jogging, and cycling, which can reduce the risk of obesity and related diseases. Studies have also linked exposure to natural environments with reduced stress levels, improved mood, and enhanced cognitive function. For children, playing in green spaces has been associated with better motor skills development and reduced symptoms of attention deficit disorders.

                    <p class="passage-text">
                        Despite these benefits, many urban areas face challenges in preserving and expanding green spaces due to competing land uses, budget constraints, and urbanization pressures. Community-led initiatives, innovative design solutions like rooftop gardens, and policy interventions that prioritize green infrastructure are becoming increasingly important in ensuring that urban residents continue to benefit from these vital natural resources.
